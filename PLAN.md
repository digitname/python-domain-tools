# PLAN



1. Implement additional domain categorization rules to handle new gTLDs.
2. Improve the 'remove_ns' function to handle a wider range of DNS server domains, including *.NS.CLOUDFLARE.COM.
3. Add hashtag functionality for domains, including a new field in the Domain model, an API endpoint for adding hashtags, and UI elements in the list_domains.html template.
4. Add timestamps to exported file names.
5. Fix the 'remove_selected' function to correctly return the count of removed domains.
6. Correct the categorization of domains with new gTLDs (e.g., solo.startup should be recognized as a TLD).
